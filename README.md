# Antivirus-Evasion-Sample
Python code which demonstrates how an malicious person can overwrites a file with harmless signature when it actually has some malicious intents to evade modern Antiviruses. First remove the commented section and run the code and then comment it out and use just line 12 and 14 to see the output

When you run the script it will create a harmless.py file with the base64 encode and then when comment out again the lines it will give you the PATH.
